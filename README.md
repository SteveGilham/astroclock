# astroclock
A GUI toolkit kata

This is a program that started life as a learning aid for X, c1990, and that I've kept porting to new GUI environments over the years to help me learn my way around the new libraries.  In this repo, I've placed as `archive` the original F#/Silverlight (2 and 3) from 2008-9, a CoffeeScript implementation from c2014 on `astroclock.js`, and the latest motivation, ports of the Silverlight code to OpenSilver (`astroclock` and `Inversion`), of which the latter is my preferred approach.
